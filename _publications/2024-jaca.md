This paper focuses on a shape optimization method applied to fluid-to-fluid
heat exchangers. We consider the framework of two fluids separated by a solid thin layer
(the wall of the pipes) and we perform an asymptotic expansion in order to obtain an
approximated model without thin layer. Due to this approximation, the multi-physics
problem is reduced to a weak-coupled problem, between the steady-state Navier-Stokes
equations for the two fluids dynamics and the convection-diffusion equation for the heat.
The aim is then to optimize the shape of the heat exchanger in order to maximize the heat
exchange and minimize the pressure drop. Thus, we characterize the shape derivative for
the objective functional and perform numerical simulations in two dimensions.
