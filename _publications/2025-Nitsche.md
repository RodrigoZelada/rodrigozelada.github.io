The objective of this work is to study a diffusion equation with non-standard transmission conditions, which include discontinuities and the Ventcel boundary conditions at the interface. To handle jumps and means of the flux and test-functions, we use broken Sobolev spaces. We present a Nitsche
finite element approach and compare it with a discontinuous Galerkin method. Consistency, stability and a priori error estimates are proven and numerically verified.
