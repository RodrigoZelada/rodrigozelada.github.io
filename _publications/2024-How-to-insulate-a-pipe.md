This paper focuses on a shape optimization method applied to fluid-to-fluid heat exchangers. We consider the framework of two fluids separated by a solid thin layer (the wall of the pipes) and we perform an asymptotic expansion in order to obtain an approximated model without thin layer. Due to this approximation, the multi-physics
problem is reduced to a weak-coupled problem, between the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations for the two fluids dynamics and the convection-diffusion equation for the heat.
The aim is then to optimize the shape of the heat exchanger in order to maximize the heat exchange and minimize the pressure drop. Thus, we characterize the shape derivative for the objective functional and perform numerical simulations in two dimensions.
